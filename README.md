## About WriteBolt
Writebolt was a Chrome extension designed to transform YouTube videos, web pages, or search terms into SEO-optimized blog content. It aimed to produce content that reads naturally, unlike some other AI-generated text, and was particularly useful for creating high-quality, human-sounding content for websites. The extension focused on generating content optimized for search engines, helping users improve their website's SEO. The produt has since been discontinued for reasons unknown to me.
